# CSId3Lib
Library to perform read/write of ID3 tags in MP3 files. Supporting ID3v1,ID3v2.3,ID3V2.4 tags versions.

This code is a fork of [Hugo Rumayor's project located at SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/csid3lib), which has been dormant for several years.

The primary goal of this fork was to migrate to .NET Standard 2.0, then release via NuGet. Subsequent updates focus on bug fixes, code cleanup, modern C# syntax, and performance improvements.

**This library has unresolved bugs and may not create valid tags when using more advanced settings. You're welcome to fork and fix them!**
